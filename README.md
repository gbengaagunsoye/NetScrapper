Classification of Network Traffic Flow based on User Application 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its capabilities continues to stretch with far reaching effect across various fields of human endeavor. Advances made in Computer Networking and Security has not only helped in Network intrusion detection but also facilitated the invention of the novel Machine-Learning Powered Next-Generation firewalls in 2020. Machine Learning (ML), a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI), a predictive analysis method can be used to distinguish features of network traffic in order to make deductions including but not limited to binary classification as either benign or abnormal traffic, multiclass distinction of Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attacks, also Heartbleed, DoS Hulk, DoS GoldenEye, Bot, PortScan, and Web-Attack, can be detected, which has helped network administrators make administrative decisions to secure usersâ€™ data. In this project, we attempt to classify network traffic flow based on Application layer protocols obtained by performing a DPI (Deep Packet Inspection) processing on the flows with ntopng using three (3) machine learning algorithms including K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest Classifier and Artificial Neural Network. Finally, we identified extracted best features from initial dataset and compared model performance to existing one using standard metrics. We developed a webpage using Python Flask Framework, which enables users to trace/capture traffic flow or upload it, the webpage displays the confidence percentage and classification time taken to process this flow entry. Finally, we evaluated our system using various performance metrics such as classification time and accuracy, scalability, etc.
